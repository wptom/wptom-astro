To create a national flag using CSS gradient, you will need to use the background-image property and set it to a linear gradient. You can specify the direction of the gradient using the to keyword, followed by a combination of keywords (such as top, bottom, left, and right) or angles (in degrees).

Here is an example of how you can create a gradient for the flag of France using CSS:
```css
.flag-france {
height: 200px;
width: 400px;
background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, blue, white, red);
}
```

This will create a vertical gradient that goes from blue at the top to red at the bottom, with a stripe of white in the middle. You can adjust the colors and the direction of the gradient to create the flag of any country you want.

Note: This is just an example and the actual colors and proportions of the national flag may vary.
