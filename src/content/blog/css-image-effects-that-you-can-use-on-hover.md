CSS effects can be a useful way to add some visual interest and interactivity to a website. They can help to make a website more engaging and user-friendly by adding visual cues that respond to user actions, such as hovering over an image or button.

CSS effects can also be used to create a more polished and professional look for a website. By using transitions and animations, you can create smooth and subtle effects that can help to improve the overall aesthetic of the site.

Additionally, CSS effects can be created with relatively simple code, making them a quick and easy way to add some visual interest to your website without requiring a lot of time or effort.

Overall, CSS effects can be a useful tool for enhancing the user experience and improving the visual appeal of a website.

Here is a few CSS image effects that you can use on hover:

Fade effect: You can use the opacity property and transitions to create a fade effect on hover. For example:

```css
img {
    transition: opacity 0.5s;
    opacity: 1;
}

img:hover {
    opacity: 0.5;
}
```

Zoom effect: You can use the transform property and transitions to create a zoom effect on hover. For example:

```css
img {
    transition: transform 0.5s;
    transform: scale(1);
}

img:hover {
    transform: scale(1.2);
}
```

Rotate effect: You can use the transform property and transitions to create a rotate effect on hover. For example:

```css
img {
    transition: transform 0.5s;
    transform: rotate(0deg);
}

img:hover {
    transform: rotate(45deg);
}
```

Grayscale effect: You can use the filter property to create a grayscale effect on hover. For example:

```css
img {
    transition: filter 0.5s;
    filter: grayscale(0%);
}

img:hover {
    filter: grayscale(100%);
}
```

I hope these examples are helpful! Let me know if you have any questions.
